# SOS.LY

SOS.LY is a website made for the sole purpose of listing verified landline emergency numbers in Libya.
The project is open source and will be periodically updated since the Libyan state does not provide easily accessible online references for the public to the public service organizations.
*Note*: These numbers are verified and have been provided to us by these public service organizations.

## Built With
